# exploring

This guide was made as a part of my own explorations and curiosities in Computer Science. I used to ask my college seniors, _"What should I do in these 4 years to make them memorable?!"_, _"How do I get a taste of everything?"_. Well, there never was a satisfactory answer and when my turn came to answer these questions, inevitably, neither could I provide the same. This is because the answer is too subjective and we are to lazy to jump into the specifics. This repository is just **one of the approaches to the aforementioned question**. I hope this helps you, the reader, in some way or the other! :)

I am making this guide **without any purpose of self-profit**. This is to help the future generations of this branch as well as anyone who ever wants to learn! I intend to add various disciplines and their resources with the help of others and then maybe add some _"not-so-useful"_ stuff too in the future.

I will try to make this README more helpful and informative in the future, and maybe add links to the specific portions of the guide here itself. As of now, this guide only mentions the various CS fields, though, I plan on adding some specifics such as some historic references about CS, trusted guides to programming languages, mastering tools such as Git and.. thats all I can think of right now.

The guide is located in the `guide.md` file.

Also, when adding things, please keep the formatting consistent! It will be of great help to me! Keep the information added discrete and not too descriptive.
PS: Please suggest a more apt and crisp name for this repository and its description ;)
