### Introduction to CS
-------------------------------
This section contains the starter pack to understanding Computer Science.
One obviously needs an introduction to the field before picking up an interest.
Sometimes it takes people an year of exploration before they can pick a field of
their choice and it is genuine because everything seems to be gold at the start,
right? I am putting so much emphasis on this section because this may be the most
crucial part of this whole journey, _trying to pick something to work upon_.

- **[Map of Computer Science](https://youtu.be/SzJ46YA_RaA)**: A detailed video(sort of?) on CS and its disciplines. A must watch
- **Harvard's CS50(please add a working link here)**: A really good and highly recommended course on introduction to CS. It      also provides a hands-on to the student.


### Contributing to Open Source
-------------------------------
The phrase you hear the most after coming to IITR is '1 cr ka package pakka' followed by 'Open source mein contribute kar!(*Tr:* Contribute to Open Source!!). So what exactly is  Open Source? How to get started in Open Source? You may find tons of definitions online, but here is a ~concise~ and _maybe_ easy to understand version.

  - **Open Source code** is a piece of code/program/application whose code is available online for free. This means that the code  is free to use and modify(though there may be certain extra constraints as well which depend on the licence used by the code).

  - Such programs may be developed by a person(s) or organization(s) and is maintained by a community of people who find the software interesting or worth contributing to. Some examples of tools/software falling in the open source category are: Git, Linux, VLC, OpenOffice, dia, etc.
  
  - Now, the main question is, **How to contribute to Open Source???!!** Mind you, this is a very subjective answer and may vary from person to person, but here it goes. _Generally_, Opn Source communities are very friendly to newcomers and help an enthusiastic learner a lot in getting started with contributions. Many organisations have a `Contributing` or `MyFirstContribution` type of guides which guide a newbie in getting around the code and provide an overview of the contribution process and what counts as contribution and how to start. Here is [Git's](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/MyFirstContribution.txt) guide. Many communities have a slack channel too for communication.
  
  - **How do I choose an organisation?!** The answer is well _not so simple_. It is totally upto someone which organisation does one have to choose to contribute to. Generally, it depends on which programming language interests you and what are **your** interests. For instance if someone has interests in networks and communication protocols and the like, they _may_ like OpenSSL. It is not necessary to contribute to a big shot organisation for starters. Some known names in Open source whose codebases are well-maintained are:
    - OpenSSL
    - Git
    - CGAL(Computational Geometry and Algorithms Library)
    - Kubernetes
    - tensorflow
    - boost
    - OpenCV, to name a few..
   
    Also, one can look at the Google Summer of Code Organizations page. I am advising this because it has a ton of  organisations, using different types of languages and tools, all at one place.
    
  
  - **Why contribute to Open Source?** Because, you get to learn tons of new things! Such organisations have a codebase which spans millions of lines hence this aids in increasing one's capability to connect the dots in a large codebase(which two functions and classes are related to each other etc.) Open source orgs have a **NO bullshit policy**, meaning they don't tolerate people who don't want to learn and are just depending on others to write their code. They are very nitpicky meaning they look at the smallest of the errors possible, ranging from using tabs instead of spaces, to a ill-formed commit message. They provide a genuine opportunity to someone to grow.
  
  - Though this is not _exactly_ related to open source, but my advice to the reader would be that they try answering to people's questions on StackOverlfow and Reddit because these websites too have a no-bullshit policy and if you try to mess around with them you get downvoted to hell.
  
 I hope this helps you :)

### Computer Architecture
-------------------------------
This deals with the design of computers, and how their are architected. Really cool if you like knowing how stuff works and so on. [MIT's 6.004](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2017/) is a great place to start. 

### Operating Systems
-------------------------------
Super tough and super rewarding if you get it right.
There are different things that one may look for when trying to learn operating systems:
* How to use operating systems: This deals with the interfaces they provide and a good book on this is [The Linux Programming Interface](http://man7.org/tlpi/). It deals with the features that linux provides to the user at the basic level. Really helpful to understand the interfaces that operating systems provide.
* Operating system concepts: This deals with abstract ideas of how operating systems work, their policies and mechanisms, and their role in a computer system. A computer science undergraduate would typically learn this in one of his courses. An excellent book to start off would be [Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/). Try to read Professor Andrew S. Tanenbaum's books as well (He made Minix).
* Operating system development: This deals with making an operating system/components of it. It is arguably the toughest task in Computer Engineering. Doing this is HARD! A good place to start would be the [OsDev wiki](wiki.osdev.org).


### Competitive Coding
-------------------------------
<p align="justify">
To start with Competitive Programming there are a few prerequisites. It is highly advisable to first start with these basics(if you have not yet done so) and only then move forward. These include:</br>
•	Get familiar with at least one programming language. C++ is highly advisable followed by python. Though you may choose any other language too.</br>
•	Understand the needs and implementations of different data structures in the language. For example, in C++ checkout the STL, vectors, maps, sets, lists, stacks, queues etc.</br>

After this, you should start with the basic problems, the ones having higher acceptance ratio or the ones with many correct submissions, and then move on to tougher problems slowly. It is very necessary to find the best approach for the problem. Don’t get a habit to just submit a working code and then move on to the next problem. Try to analyse your solution and enhance its time and space complexities. Also try to implement any pre-existing algorithm and do not just find brute-force solutions.

To learn new algorithms, the ‘Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS’ is a very good book. Read the topics that you are willing to learn or need to learn, completely. Try not to skip sub-sections from it and clear any doubts you have. Another source can be http://cp-algorithms.com/. It is a good collection of several important algorithms and their pseudo-code implementations.

Also, try to focus on one topic at a time in the beginning. For example, if you read about Dynamic Programming, try to solve a few problems on it to get a better understanding of the topic, before moving further. You can read about its different variations and what are its main uses on the go.

Do not neglect some topics that you consider are trivial. If you have not read the topics formally but have rough ideas about it, you should at least give it a reading. For example, you may have some ideas about Number Theory or Game Theory, but might not know some theorems relating to it, which are in general quite useful. Nevertheless, this can be skipped if you feel confident about the topic.

The platforms that are highly advisable include:   
•	Codeforces   
•	Spoj   
•	Hackerrank   
•	Codechef   

In the beginning focus on learning concepts and not improving your contest ratings. This is very helpful and in fact necessary. If you have weak concepts, it may create a huge problem in the longer run. Refrain from focusing on quantity of knowledge over quality.

These are just a few things to keep in mind as a beginner. You will be able to figure out other things as you move on. All the best! Cheers.
